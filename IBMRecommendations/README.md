# Recommendations for IBM Project

### Instructions:
In the IBM Watson Studio, there is a large collaborative community ecosystem of articles, datasets, notebooks, and other A.I. and ML. assets. Users of the system interact with all of this. Within this scope, we created this recommendation system project to enhance the user experience and connect them with assets. This personalizes the experience for each user

File Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb contains all the code to deal with the problems. So we will experience with some methodogies for recommendation with that data.
